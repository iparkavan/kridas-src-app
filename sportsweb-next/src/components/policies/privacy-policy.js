        When you create an account with KRIDAS, we may ask you for personally
        identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can

        number, email address, home address, city, country and your friends
        email addresses (which we will only use in order to invite them to use

        your personal preferences and interests such as the sports you play and
        your sports characteristic such as right-handed, left-handed etc. for
        each sport. You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the
        information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to take
        advantage of some or all of our features. You can register by logging
        into your account with certain third-party social networking sites

        Information”). Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such
        as your “real” name, email address and other information you make
        publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS
        and use that information to create your Account; the information we
        extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. We
        will only gather information that you allow us to gather from the SNS.
        Once youve created an Account, you can optionally choose to contribute
        or create the following types of information publicly viewable
        information in accordance with our Terms of Service (“Public
