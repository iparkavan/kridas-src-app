        it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
        required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against
        you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that
        you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking
        steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment
        and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can
        still require you to make the payment at a later date.{" "}
